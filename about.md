### Overview

I am currently a Masters of Robotics graduate student at Northwestern University who is interested in entering the field of prosthetic robotics. My current goal is to intern or work at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, however I am open to other fields that relate to Robotics like aerospace or mechanical. It would be exciting to work on self-driving cars at any company that is developing this type of vehicle or working with the government on building military robots. 

I believe in the self-improvement of people, so I would love to build voice controlled exercise machines, bionic arms and legs for amputees, and exoskeletons for soliders to increase their defenses and strength. Hopefully, my final project in the Summer of Fall of 2017 will pertain to one of the ideas written about above.
