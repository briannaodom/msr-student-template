## Cozmo Following RC Car 

Cozmo a mini toy from the California based company Anki, was programmed to follow an RC car by following the positions of ar tags. These positions were used to calculate the linear and rotational velocities of Cozmo through the use of ROS. A PID controller and trajectory equations shall be written to decrease the error in Cozmo's movements, while following the RC Car. This project is still ongoing but can be followed with the github link below.

This is the [Github respository](https://github.com/briannaodom/cozmo_winter_project) for the cozmo_winter_project.
