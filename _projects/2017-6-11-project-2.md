## Assisted Abwheel

The goal of this project is to create an assisted abwheel that will allow a user to obtain some kind of assistance while exercising with this particular device. Imagine an individual who hasn't worked out in years, is out of shape, has some kind of disability, or just is lacking in physical strength tries to use an abwheel for the first time. A great amount of core and upper arm strength are needed to get an individual back in plank/knee position. Hopefully, by the end of the summer, there will be a prototype of a human sized abwheel that has varying levels of resistance to aid an individual in working out until they can manually use the abwheel without any assistance at all. 

This is the current [Github respository](https://github.com/briannaodom/FinalProject).
